Analyzing ridership 2016 Citibike dataset
Research Question:  “What variables will most accurately predict whether it will be a busy day of Citi Bike?”  
We believe that this question would be beneficial in optimizing distance between an existing bike station and any new stations. As well as planning for additional docks at existing bike stations.   
Citi Bike is the most widely used bike-sharing program in New York City. Our team aggregated 2016 Citi Bike data and merged the weather data of that year in order to research the effects of weather on bike shares.
